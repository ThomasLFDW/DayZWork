DESCRIPTION
===========
ARP is simply designed to give mission makers more options to make missions more immersive. 
ARP adds 50 items (more each update) that can be added to inventories as needed to add a 
last touch to missions.

For example this could be used to add more common items to civilians so that, when searched, 
the player finds more common and realistic items on them. Instead of finding a compass, 
map and radio you might find a lighter, candy and a newspaper. 

Want to give your soldiers the last touch towards realism? Throw some extra socks, underwear 
and t shirts into your rucksack in case the mission takes longer. Don't forget your baby wipes,
i know i used them in the field a lot when showers were not an option :P. Make sure you have 
an ID Card on you to get back onto base maybe? Or give an entire village a red color shemagh 
and give your target a white one to identify him.

the possibilities are limited to your imagination, I'm just providing the tools. 

Again, ARP alone has no functions available so these are purely intended for sort of Role 
play at this time and only work in the inventory. When they are dropped on the ground they 
will look like small military bags. Maybe later down the road myself or somebody within the 
community will add functions, actions, or even entire modules that use this.

Special Thanks:
==============
Special thanks for the inspiration by Glowbal interaction and items mod. Without his help 
this addon could not have been made. 

Also a big thank you goes to Kylania/Pirin for providing Intel that gave this mod the final 
touch.
